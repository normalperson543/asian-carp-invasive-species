          <h2>What is Asian Carp?</h2>
          <p>Asian carp can refer to the types of fish found in Asia. In North America, Asian carp can refer to the bighead or silver carp in North America <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>. Black carp and grass carp can also be considered Asian carp, as they are native to Asia <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.)</span>.</p>
          <p>The bighead, grass, black and silver carp are all <em>invasive</em> to the US as identified by the USDA <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.)</span>. These species may also be called <em>invasive carp</em> <span class="citation">(Biological Threats and Invasive Species Research Program, 2022)</span>.</p>
          <p>Throughout this page, "Asian carp" will refer to the species of carp that were originally native to Asia but may have invaded the United States. More specifically, we refer to the bighead, grass, black and silver carp.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Asian carp are primarily invasive because of these key factors.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They have been found in places outside of their native areas <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.)</span>.</li>
        <li>They can grow very fast <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.)</span>.</li>
        <li>Their populations can also grow very fast <span class="citation">(U.S. Geological Survey, n.d.)</span>.</li>
        <li>They have negative effects on our ecosystem <span class="citation">(National Park Service, 2023)</span>.</li>
        <li>They can outcompete native species <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.)</span>.</li>
        <li>They have a very big appetite for food <span class="citation">(Holmes, 2021)</span>.</li>

      </div>
      <h3>Invaded Areas</h3>
      <p>Asian carp have mostly invaded the Mississippi River <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.).</span>. In May 2019, grass carp were reported as a threat to vegetation in 45 states, the highest number of states that a species invasive carp have invaded in the US <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>. However, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey, this number may have grown up to an estimated 47 states <span class="citation">("Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1844)", 2020)</span>.</p>
      <h3>How It Got Here</h3>
      <p>These species were primarily introduced to stock aquaculture facilities to control species <span class="citation">(Biological Threats and Invasive Species Research Program, 2022)</span>. Some types of carp may have been brought as part of food markets <span class="citation">(U.S. Geological Survey, n.d.)</span>.</p>
      <p>These types of carp escaped their way out of where they were stocked and found themselves in the Mississippi River, where they invaded <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.)</span>. Floods may also have played a part in escapement of the Asian carp <span class="citation">("California's Invaders: Bighead Carp", n.d., "California's Invaders: Black Carp", n.d.)</span> Accidential releases can also cause carp to end up in the Mississippi River <span class="citation">("Invasive Carp | National Invasive Species Information Center", n.d.)</span>. For example, grass carp was released into Arkansas waterways, and spread to the Arkansas River, and eventually into the Mississippi River drainage <span class="citation">("California's Invaders: Grass Carp", n.d.)</span>.</p>
      <p>Asian carp can also invade other areas through:</p>

      <h3>Ecological Problems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Silver and bighead carp are <em>filter feeders</em>, and eat plankton fairly aggressively <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>. Since native fish need the plankton through their young stages, it can throw off the food web and make it less stable <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>. Bighead carp can be considered to outcompete native fish through this way <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Black carp can eat native endangered/reintroduced species, putting them at risk <span class="citation">(National Park Service, 2023)</span>.</li>
        <li>
          Silver and bighead carp can also outcompete native sport fish <span class="citation">("Invasive carp in Southeastern waters | U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service", n.d.)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Can dominate streams and push out species <span class="citation">(National Park Service, 2023).</li>
        <li>Black carp can consume mussels, which can improve water quality <span class="citation">("Invasive carp in Southeastern waters | U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service", n.d.)</span>. Removing these mussels through the introduction of black carp can decrease water quality.</li>
        <li>Asian carp makes up <b>95%</b> of the biomass in the Mississippi and Illinois River systems <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>.</li>
        <li>
          Any remaining plants that grass carp do not eat will get into the water, which can create algal blooms, and this reduces water clarity and oxygen <span class="citation">(Holmes, 2021)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Grass carp can carry Asian tapeworms <span class="citation">("California's Invaders: Grass Carp", n.d.)</span>.</li>
        <li>Grass carp can impact spawning habitats when they disturb water during feeding  <span class="citation">("California's Invaders: Grass Carp", n.d.)</span>.</li>
        <li>Grass carp can have a big appetite for plants, which can wipe out a lot of vegetation from the water. This reduces the availability of habitats <span class="citation">("California's Invaders: Grass Carp", n.d.)</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Economic Problems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Silver carp can jump up to 10 feet out of the water and often together when it hears boats or motors, which can damage equipment or even pose an injury risk to people
 <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>Invasive carp aren't worth much in money <span class="citation">(Holmes, 2021)</span>.</li>
        <li>Invasive carp can reduce populations of native fish that anglers depend on <span class="citation">(National Park Service, 2023)</span></li>
        <li>If the carp get into the Great Lakes, it may threaten the $7 billion fishing industry <span class="citation">(National Park Service, 2023)</span></li>

      <h2>What People are Doing</h2>
      <p>In the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, there are electrical barriers that create a field of current to deter carp from swimming through, to prevent the further spread of these species into the Great Lakes <span class="citation">(New York Invasive Species Information, 2019)</span>. A bio-acoustic fence in Kentucky is being deployed to use air bubbles, sound and light to reduce movement of carp through locks in large rivers <span class="citation">("Invasive carp in Southeastern waters | U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service", n.d.)</span>.</p>
      <p>The University of Minnesota's Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center has also found that some kinds of invasive carp can be deterred through sound and air curtains, biocontrol through viruses, and food odors that lure carp to poisoned food <span class="citation">(Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center, n.d.)</span>. Improvements in netting and catching fish, work on remote sensing to improve harvests of carp, and commercial fishing also aim to reduce the populations of invasive carp <span class="citation">(Invasive Carp Regional Coordinating Committee, n.d.)</span>. A technique called the Modified Unified Method is also being deployed to use boats, nets, speakers and gear to gather and remove carp, which in past testing has yielded up to 90% of carp <span class="citation">("Invasive carp in Southeastern waters | U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service", n.d.)</span>.</p>
